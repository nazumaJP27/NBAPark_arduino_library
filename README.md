# 🏀 NBA Park Arduino Library

The NBA Park Arduino Library is a custom-built software toolkit developed by the **IT/Infrastructure team** at NBA Park Gramado. It provides a set of reusable classes, sensor handling logic, and example programs used in interactive basketball-themed attractions throughout the park.
